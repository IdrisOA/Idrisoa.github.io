# Hi, welcome to my website!

  My research interest is primarily focused on applying statistical methods (ranging from machine learning algorithms to survival analysis) for topics in statistical genetics and genomics. My ultimate goal is to become a Professor of Biostatistics, actively contributing to the design and analysis of studies that address pressing global health issues in our world. I aspire to collaborate with multidisciplinary researchers to translate statistical findings into actionable insights, thereby influencing health policies and interventions. 
                
I studied Statistics as an undergraduate at the [University of Nigeria, Nsukka](https://www.unn.edu.ng/) where I graduated with a Bachelor's in Statistics advised by [Dr. Eugene C. Ukaegbu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ndk6FJUAAAAJ&hl=en).
My first exposure to Biostatistics was during my internship at the [National Agency for Food and Drug Administration & Control (NAFDAC)](https://www.nafdac.gov.ng) where I worked as a Research Assistant in the year 2015 and to date I've been contributing and improving on my skillsets in the biomedical area of statistics. 

More so, my interest in statistical genetics and genomics started during my undergraduate project, I investigated cancer patients and cancer-related death cases at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital (UNTH), Enugu State, Nigeria using two-way MANOVA in experimental design and analysis.
